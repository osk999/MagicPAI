# Applying Alterations

Instead of submitting alteration plans for asynchronous execution, you can apply alterations immediately using the `IAlterationRunner` service. For example:

```csharp
var alterations = new List<IAlteration>
{
    new ModifyVariable("MyVariable", "MyValue")
};

var workflowInstanceIds = new[] { "26cf02e60d4a4be7b99a8588b7ac3bb9" };
var runner = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IAlterationRunner>();
var results = await runner.RunAsync(plan, cancellationToken);
```

When an alteration plan is run immediately, "the alterations are applied synchronously, and the results are returned." You will have to manually schedule affected workflow instances to resume execution. Use the `IAlteredWorkflowDispatcher`:

```csharp
var dispatcher = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IAlteredWorkflowDispatcher>();
await dispatcher.DispatchAsync(results, cancellationToken);
```

This will instruct the workflow engine to pick up the altered workflow instances and execute them.
