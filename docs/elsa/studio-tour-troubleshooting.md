## Creating Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow step-by-step.

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Navigate to **Workflows** from the left menu
2. Click **"Create Workflow"** button
3. Enter workflow details:
   * **Name**: "Hello World"
   * **Description**: "My first Elsa workflow"
4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Add Activities

1. **Add a WriteLine Activity**:
   * Find "WriteLine" in the Activity Toolbox (under Console or Diagnostics)
   * Drag it onto the canvas
   * Click the activity to select it
2. **Configure WriteLine**:
   * In the Properties Panel, under **Input** tab:
   * **Text**: Enter `"Hello, Elsa!"` (use Literal syntax)
   * Note: The activity is now configured to log this message
3. **Add a Delay Activity**:
   * Drag "Delay" from toolbox onto canvas
   * Place it to the right of WriteLine
4. **Configure Delay**:
   * Select the Delay activity
   * **Duration**: Enter `00:00:02` (2 seconds) or use C# expression: `TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)`
5. **Add Another WriteLine**:
   * Drag another WriteLine activity
   * **Text**: `"Workflow completed!"`

### Step 3: Connect Activities

1. Click the **output port** (right side) of the first WriteLine
2. Drag to the **input port** (left side) of the Delay activity
3. Connect Delay to the second WriteLine

Your workflow should show: `WriteLine -> Delay -> WriteLine`

### Step 4: Save and Publish

1. Click **"Save"** in the toolbar
2. Click **"Publish"** to activate the workflow
3. Confirm publication

### Step 5: Run the Workflow

1. Click the **Run button** in the toolbar
2. Watch as the workflow executes
3. Check the **Workflow Instances** to see the execution result

## Debugging Workflow Execution

Debugging is essential for understanding why workflows behave unexpectedly.

### Using the Execution Journal

The execution journal is your primary debugging tool.

**Accessing the Journal:**

1. Go to **Workflow Instances**
2. Find your workflow execution
3. Click to view details
4. Navigate to the **Journal** or **Timeline** tab

**What to Look For:**

* **Activity Sequence**: Verify activities executed in the expected order
* **Activity States**:
  * Completed successfully
  * Faulted (error occurred)
  * Suspended (waiting)
* **Timestamps**: Identify slow activities
* **Input/Output Values**: Check if data is correct
* **Outcomes**: Verify branching logic (e.g., "Done", "200", "404")

**Example Journal Entry:**

```
[2025-11-20 10:30:15] WriteLine (Activity1) - Completed
  Input: Text = "Hello, Elsa!"
  Outcome: Done

[2025-11-20 10:30:15] Delay (Activity2) - Completed
  Input: Duration = 00:00:02
  Outcome: Done

[2025-11-20 10:30:17] WriteLine (Activity3) - Completed
  Input: Text = "Workflow completed!"
  Outcome: Done
```

### Understanding Workflow States

* **Running**: Workflow is actively executing
* **Suspended**: Workflow is waiting for:
  * External event (e.g., HTTP request, timer)
  * User input
  * Bookmark to be resumed
* **Finished**: All activities completed successfully
* **Faulted**: An error occurred, workflow stopped
* **Cancelled**: Manually stopped by user or system

### Common Error Patterns

#### Expression Errors

**Problem**: Expression syntax errors prevent activity execution

**Symptoms:**

* Activity shows error icon
* Journal shows "Expression evaluation failed"
* Workflow enters Faulted state

**Example Error:**

```
Expression evaluation failed: variables.OrderTotal is undefined
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Variable Exists**: Ensure variable is created and spelled correctly
2. **Verify Syntax**: Match expression syntax to selected language
   * JavaScript: `variables.OrderTotal`
   * C#: `Variables.OrderTotal`
   * Liquid: `{{ Variables.OrderTotal }}`
3. **Check Variable Initialization**: Make sure variable is set before use
4. **Use WriteLine for Debugging**: Log variable values to verify data

#### Null Reference Errors

**Problem**: Accessing properties of null objects

**Symptoms:**

* "Object reference not set to an instance of an object"
* Activity fails unexpectedly

**Example:**

```csharp
Variables.User.Email  // User is null
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Null Check**: Use conditional logic

   ```csharp
   Variables.User != null ? Variables.User.Email : "No email"
   ```
2. **Safe Navigation** (C#):

   ```csharp
   Variables.User?.Email ?? "No email"
   ```
3. **Default Values**: Initialize variables with default values

#### Connection Errors

**Problem**: Activities not properly connected

**Symptoms:**

* Workflow stops after first activity
* Some activities never execute

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Connections**: Ensure all activities are connected
2. **Verify Outcomes**: Connect to correct outcome port (e.g., "Done", "True", "False")
3. **Visual Inspection**: Follow the flow from start to end

#### HTTP Activity Errors

**Problem**: HTTP Request activities fail

**Common Errors:**

1. **404 Not Found**
   * URL is incorrect
   * Solution: Verify URL, check for typos
2. **401 Unauthorized**
   * Missing or invalid authentication
   * Solution: Add headers with authorization token
3. **Timeout**
   * Server not responding
   * Solution: Increase timeout, check server availability
4. **SSL/TLS Errors**
   * Certificate validation failed
   * Solution: Check server certificate, consider bypassing validation (dev only)

**Example HTTP Request Configuration:**

**URL (C#):**

```csharp
return $"https://api.example.com/users/{Variables.UserId}";
```

**Headers (JavaScript):**

```javascript
{
  "Authorization": `Bearer ${variables.ApiToken}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Debugging Techniques

#### 1. Use WriteLine Liberally

Add WriteLine activities to log variable values:

```javascript
// Log variable value
`UserId: ${variables.UserId}, Total: ${variables.OrderTotal}`
```

#### 2. Check Variable Values in Journal

The execution journal shows input/output values for each activity.

#### 3. Test Expressions Independently

Use a Set Variable activity to test complex expressions:

```csharp
// Test this expression
Variables.Orders.Where(x => x.Total > 1000).Count()
```

#### 4. Simplify Complex Workflows

* Comment out activities temporarily
* Test one path at a time
* Gradually add complexity

#### 5. Use Conditional Breakpoints

Add If activities with logging to trace execution:

```javascript
// Condition
variables.Debug === true

// Log in True branch
`Debug: At checkpoint 1, UserId = ${variables.UserId}`
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Design-Time Errors

#### Cannot Save Workflow

**Symptoms:**

* Save button doesn't work
* Error message appears

**Common Causes:**

1. **Validation Errors**: Activities have invalid configurations
2. **Disconnected Activities**: Orphaned activities on canvas
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Activities reference each other cyclically

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Activity Validation**: Look for red indicators on activities
2. **Review Connections**: Ensure all activities are properly connected
3. **Remove Unused Activities**: Delete orphaned activities
4. **Simplify**: Break complex workflows into smaller workflows

#### Activity Configuration Issues

**Symptoms:**

* Activity shows error icon
* Cannot publish workflow

**Common Issues:**

1. **Missing Required Fields**
   * Solution: Fill in all required input fields
2. **Invalid Expression Syntax**
   * Solution: Test expressions in a simple Set Variable activity first
3. **Type Mismatch**
   * Solution: Ensure variable types match expected inputs
   * Example: Don't pass a string to an integer field

#### Variables Not Appearing

**Symptoms:**

* Variable not in dropdown
* Expression can't access variable

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Scope**: Ensure variable is created at workflow level
2. **Refresh**: Save and reload the workflow
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Match exact variable name (case-sensitive in some contexts)
4. **Create Explicitly**: Use Variables panel to create variables

### Runtime Failures

#### Workflow Doesn't Start

**Symptoms:**

* Trigger doesn't fire
* No instance created

**Common Causes:**

1. **Workflow Not Published**
   * Solution: Publish the workflow
2. **Trigger Activity Not Configured**
   * Solution: Check "Trigger Workflow" in activity's Common properties
3. **HTTP Endpoint Path Conflict**
   * Solution: Ensure path is unique across workflows
4. **Server Not Running**
   * Solution: Verify Elsa Server is running and accessible

#### Workflow Gets Stuck in Running State

**Symptoms:**

* Workflow shows "Running" indefinitely
* Never completes or suspends

**Common Causes:**

1. **Infinite Loop**
   * While or ForEach without exit condition
   * Solution: Add proper exit conditions
2. **Blocking Activity Without Timeout**
   * HTTP Request hanging
   * Solution: Set timeout values
3. **Deadlock**
   * Circular bookmark dependencies
   * Solution: Review workflow logic, simplify

**Debugging Steps:**

1. Check execution journal to see last completed activity
2. Review activity after last completed one
3. Add timeout configurations
4. Cancel and redesign problematic section

#### Workflow Fails Silently

**Symptoms:**

* Workflow finishes but doesn't produce expected results
* No errors shown

**Common Causes:**

1. **Exception Swallowed**
   * Try-catch blocks without logging
   * Solution: Add error logging
2. **Wrong Branch Taken**
   * Conditional logic error
   * Solution: Add WriteLine to log which branch executes
3. **Variable Not Updated**
   * Expression doesn't modify variable as expected
   * Solution: Log variable values before and after

#### Data Loss in Variables

**Symptoms:**

* Variable values disappear
* Variables reset unexpectedly

**Common Causes:**

1. **Wrong Storage Location**
   * Using "Memory" storage for long-running workflows
   * Solution: Use "Workflow Instance" storage
2. **Variable Scope Issues**
   * Activity-scoped variable not accessible
   * Solution: Use workflow-level variables
3. **Overwriting Variables**
   * Multiple Set Variable activities with same variable
   * Solution: Review all assignments to the variable

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Workflow Execution

**Symptoms:**

* Workflows take longer than expected
* Timeouts occur

**Common Causes:**

1. **Expensive Operations in Loops**
   * API calls inside ForEach
   * Solution: Batch operations, use parallel processing
2. **Large Data Sets**
   * Processing thousands of records
   * Solution: Implement pagination, chunking
3. **Synchronous HTTP Requests**
   * Waiting for multiple API calls sequentially
   * Solution: Use parallel HTTP activities or bulk operations
4. **No Indexes on Database**
   * Slow database queries
   * Solution: Optimize database schema

**Optimization Tips:**

1. **Use Bulk Operations**

   ```csharp
   // Instead of loop with API calls
   // Use single bulk API call
   ```
2. **Parallel Execution**
   * Use ParallelForEach for independent operations
3. **Cache Results**
   * Store frequently used data in variables
4. **Optimize Expressions**
   * Complex LINQ queries can be slow
   * Pre-filter data before processing

#### High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:**

* Server runs out of memory
* Workflows fail with OutOfMemoryException

**Common Causes:**

1. **Loading Large Objects**
   * Entire file loaded into memory
   * Solution: Stream data instead
2. **Many Long-Running Workflows**
   * Each suspended workflow consumes memory
   * Solution: Configure workflow persistence, use retention policies
3. **Variable Storage**
   * Large objects in Workflow Instance storage
   * Solution: Use external storage for large data

**Solutions:**

1. **Use Streaming**
   * Process files in chunks
   * Don't load entire file into variable
2. **Clean Up Variables**
   * Remove large variables when no longer needed
3. **Configure Retention**
   * Automatically clean up completed workflow instances
4. **Use External Storage**
   * Store large files in blob storage
   * Store references in workflow variables

#### Workflow Instance Database Growth

**Symptoms:**

* Database size grows rapidly
* Queries become slow

**Solutions:**

1. **Configure Retention Policies**

   ```csharp
   // In Elsa Server configuration
   services.AddElsa(elsa => elsa
       .UseRetention(r =>
       {
           r.SweepInterval = TimeSpan.FromDays(1);
           r.AddDeletePolicy("Delete old workflows", _ => new RetentionWorkflowInstanceFilter()
           {
               FinishedBefore = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-30)
           });
       }));
   ```
2. **Disable Activity State Persistence** (when not needed)
   * Use LogPersistenceMode property
3. **Archive Old Instances**
   * Move completed instances to archive storage
   * Keep only recent data in primary database
4. **Regular Cleanup**
   * Schedule maintenance jobs to delete old instances

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design

#### 1. Keep It Simple

* **One Responsibility**: Each workflow should have a single, clear purpose
* **Modular Design**: Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable workflows
* **Use Descriptive Names**: Activities, variables, and workflows should have clear names

**Example:**

```
Bad: "Activity1", "Activity2", "temp"
Good: "FetchUserData", "ValidateOrder", "customerEmail"
```

#### 2. Document Your Workflows

* Add descriptions to workflows
* Use comments in activities (via Description field)
* Document complex expressions

#### 3. Error Handling

* Anticipate failures
* Add error handling branches
* Log errors for debugging
* Provide meaningful error messages

**Example Error Handling:**

```
HTTP Request
├─ 200 OK -> Process Response
├─ 404 Not Found -> Handle Missing Resource
├─ 500 Server Error -> Retry Logic
└─ Timeout -> Alert and Fail Gracefully
```

#### 4. Variable Management

* **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase or PascalCase consistently
* **Minimize Scope**: Use activity-scoped variables when possible
* **Appropriate Storage**: Match storage to workflow lifetime
* **Type Safety**: Use specific types instead of Object when possible

#### 5. Testing Strategy

* **Test Each Path**: Verify all conditional branches
* **Test Edge Cases**: Empty data, null values, maximum values
* **Test Error Scenarios**: Simulate failures
* **Use Test Data**: Don't test with production data

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Avoid Unnecessary Persistence

* Use "Memory" storage for transient data
* Configure LogPersistenceMode to reduce database writes

#### 2. Batch Operations

* Process records in batches instead of one-by-one
* Use bulk APIs when available

#### 3. Caching

* Cache frequently accessed data
* Reuse API responses within workflow

#### 4. Async Operations

* Use asynchronous activities for I/O operations
* Enable parallel execution where appropriate

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Protect Sensitive Data

* Don't log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
* Use secure storage for credentials
* Encrypt sensitive variables

#### 2. Validate Inputs

* Always validate external inputs
* Sanitize data to prevent injection attacks
* Check for expected data types

#### 3. Use HTTPS

* Always use HTTPS for HTTP activities
* Validate SSL certificates

#### 4. Implement Authorization

* Check user permissions in workflows
* Don't expose sensitive endpoints without authentication

### Maintainability

#### 1. Version Control

* Use workflow versioning
* Document changes between versions
* Keep old versions for rollback

#### 2. Consistent Style

* Establish team conventions
* Use consistent naming patterns
* Apply same design patterns across workflows

#### 3. Code Reuse

* Create reusable workflows
* Use workflow variables for configuration
* Share common logic via Dispatch Workflow activity

### Common Workflow Patterns

#### 1. Request-Response Pattern

```
HTTP Endpoint -> Process Request -> HTTP Response
```

**Use Case**: REST API endpoints, webhooks

#### 2. Retry Pattern

```
HTTP Request -> Check Status
├─ Success -> Continue
└─ Failure -> Delay -> Retry (loop back)
```

**Use Case**: Resilient API calls

#### 3. Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern

```
Start -> ParallelForEach -> Process Items -> Join Results
```

**Use Case**: Parallel processing of items

#### 4. Saga Pattern

```
Step 1 -> Step 2 -> Step 3
  |         |         |
Compensate 1 <- Compensate 2 <- Compensate 3
```

**Use Case**: Distributed transactions with rollback

#### 5. Event Listener Pattern

```
Event Trigger (suspend) -> Wait for Event -> Resume -> Process
```

**Use Case**: Long-running workflows waiting for external events
